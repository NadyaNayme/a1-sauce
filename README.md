# a1-sauce
 A little sauce to go with your Alt1. A helper library made to make Alt1 plugins look more consistent with one another with a little extra to help with common functionality.

## Features

- Settings Builder - using a Fluent Interface to easily construct setting menus that match the look and feel of the NXT interfaces.
- Overlays Manager - to make controlling and updating multiple overlays easier
- Buff Finder - A wrapper around Alt1's BuffReader() to make it easier to get information about a specific buff by name using known thresholds and data.png images.
- - Autoupdate / Update Notifier - Lets your users know if you've pushed a new release and either refreshes automatically or allows the user to refresh and update on their own time (keeping in mind combat-related plugins and the user might be in-combats)
- Patch Notes -  to keep your users informed of recent changes to your plugins. If the user is on a version they haven't used before they'll get a one-time, closable popup with the latest changes.
